 # spider-man-turtle-
This is a turtle project using python and i did it for fun 
In this project, I have used Python turtle graphics to draw Spider-Man, a superhero who has spider-like abilities and wears a red and blue suit with a spider logo. Turtle graphics is a module in Python that allows you to create pictures and animations with a virtual turtle that moves on a screen. You can control the turtle’s position, direction, color, and pen size by writing Python code.

To draw Spider-Man, I have divided his face and body into different parts, such as his mask, eyes, suit, logo, webbing, etc. For each part, I have defined a function that draws the shape and color of that part using the turtle module’s methods and attributes. For example, to draw Spider-Man’s mask, I have used the circle() method to draw the outline of his head, the fillcolor() and begin_fill() attributes to fill it with red color, and the pencolor() attribute to change the pen color to black.

I have also used loops and recursion to create complex patterns and designs. For example, to draw Spider-Man’s webbing, I have used a loop to repeat the same commands for each line of web. To draw his spider logo, I have used recursion to draw a self-similar shape that resembles a spider.

By combining these functions and commands, I have created a realistic and colorful drawing of Spider-Man using Python turtle graphics. This project demonstrates my knowledge of Python programming, turtle graphics
